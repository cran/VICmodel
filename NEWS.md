# VICmodel 0.1.2

* Fix the bug of error when only run the model for only a single gridcell.

* Add some function to calculate Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE) and relative bias (RB) to evaluate the streamflow simulation performance.

* Longwave radiation and atmospheric pressure are not necessary forcing input now (can be estimated by elevation, air temperature, vapor pressure and solar radiation).

# VICmodel 0.1.1

* Fix some codes with bug or potential problem of the VIC source codes.

* Fix the data error of the `STEHE` sample data.

* Add the observed streamflow data to `STEHE` sample data for routing model.
